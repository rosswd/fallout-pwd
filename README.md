# Fallout Password Game
Inspired by an /r/Dailyprogrammer challenge on Reddit. Although I have never
played the game, *Fallout*,  I used my imagination to make this fun password checker.

The original challenge for the game is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3qjnil/20151028_challenge_238_intermediate_fallout/)
